# Common Exceptions in Selenium WebDriver 

1. ElementNotInteractableException - Thrown when an element is present in the DOM but interactions with that element will hit another 
element do to paint order

2. ElementNotSelectableException - Thrown when trying to select an unselectable element. For example, selecting a ‘script’ element.

3. ElementNotVisibleException - Thrown when an element is present on the DOM, but it is not visible, and so is not able to be interacted 
with. Most commonly encountered when trying to click or read text of an element that is hidden from view.

If you encounter this exception, you may want to check the following:
  * Check your selector used in your find_by...
  * Element may not yet be on the screen at the time of the find operation, (webpage is still loading) see 
  selenium.webdriver.support.wait.WebDriverWait() for how to write a wait wrapper to wait for an element to appear.
